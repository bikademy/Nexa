# Nexa Smart Contract for Bikademy Overview
This smart contract has been developed for the Bikademy mobile app, designed to mint NFTs from the Nexa market as rewards for users (Bikademy Students) who visit cultural or natural locations, known as Bikademy Exams. The contract ensures secure and transparent management of NFT rewards for participants, aligning with Bikademy’s mission to promote eco-friendly exploration by bike.

# Purpose

The primary purpose of this smart contract is to incentivize Bikademy Students to explore destinations in a green, sustainable way by awarding them NFTs upon completing specific cycling routes or Exams.
